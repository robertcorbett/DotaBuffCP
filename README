DotaBuffCP

This is merely an updated version of the DotaBuffCP found on Onur's
Github. The site needs a regular backend update that wasn't happening 
so I ported it over here to continue with the updates. All credit goes
to Onur who you can find at the link below.

See https://onur.github.io/DotaBuffCP for live version and more info.
